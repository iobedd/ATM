          ● The user will type in an amount which will be withdrawn from his account
      ■ Deposit money
          ● The user will type in an amount which will be deposited into his account
      ■ Pay bills
          ● An enumerated list of bills will be displayed and the user will be able to pick which ones he wants to 
          pay
          ● When a bill is paid money will be withdrawn from the account
          ● It should not be possible to pay the same bill twice
      ■ Show balance
          ● The current balance of the account will be displayed along with all the transactions which have 
          happened on the account since the ATM has started
